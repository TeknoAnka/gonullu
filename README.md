# Gönüllü App

The Gönüllü application is designed to compile packages for the LupuS distribution. Using Docker images, the application converts packages waiting in the build system queue into pisi packages and sends them to the build system.

You do not need to use LupuS to use this application. You can use any Linux distribution that supports Docker.
